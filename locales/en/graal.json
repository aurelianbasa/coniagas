  "graalDescription": "We are advancing the Graal project towards production to meet the rising demand for Critical Minerals from Safe Jurisdictions <br /> <br /> Evidence points to a large deposit of high-grade nickel, copper and cobalt near surface with showings of platinum and palladium and potential for a significant deposit at depth. <br /> <br /> The property is ideally located close to major battery manufacturing infrastructure with access to ports <br /> <br /> Work in the coming year will focus on exploration drilling aimed at expanding the size of the mineralized deposit area and delivering a maiden resource report",
