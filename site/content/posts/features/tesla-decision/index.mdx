As we move towards electrification of the global transport fleet one of the biggest concerns is the sourcing of cobalt. That is because approximately 70% of the world’s cobalt production comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) – A country rampant with issues such as corruption, child labor and exploitation.

The recent Telsa’s decision to source cobalt from Glencore, along with others (BMW, Samsung SDI, SK Innovation, GEM Co, and Umicore) is very concerning. It means that all these companies are totally reliant on the DRC (excluding BMW who has secured Glencore’s Australian cobalt from Murrin Murrin) for cobalt. Furthermore it means that Glencore has locked in sales of about 82% of its current cobalt production, leaving very little available cobalt supply in the market.
