*"What we have done here, originally we started just as an exploration play. Then we went to Asia and we spent a bit of time in Japan, a bit of time in China and we came back and we changed our focus. What we are doing is what we call real time development. We are going for our permits to install a mill on site. Actually we have already sourced the equipment. We are going through the permitting process now. That is the only mill that will be in the cobalt camp. We are also going through a pilot plant scale test work for developing the product that the Asian market has asked us, which is basically a cobalt-sulfate originally, now they are asking for a nickel-sulphate, a manganese sulphate and a copper-sulphate."*
