Canada Cobalt has assembled a pilot plant at its Castle property to produce bulk gravity concentrates that will be processed into cobalt sulfate. On August 15, 2018 Canada Cobalt announced that through its proprietary Re-2OX process, the Company has produced the first ever premium grade cobalt sulfate from its 100% owned Castle Mine. The 22.6% grade produced exceeds the technical specifications of cathode producers in Asia, who are in discussions with the company’s marketing representative in that region to evaluate Canada Cobalt’s sample product for potential battery sector use.

Frank Basa, President and CEO, commented: “Canada Cobalt has broken new ground as a technology leader in Canada’s most prolific cobalt district. We’ve now demonstrated that from concentrate produced from the Castle Mine, we can create a premium grade end product (cobalt sulfate) without a smelting process. This is a testament to the efficiency and effectiveness of Re-2OX, a process that’s very amenable to scaling up. We look forward to marketing the Canada Cobalt Re-2OX brand to the battery sector while we ramp up activity at the Castle mine both underground and at surface.”
