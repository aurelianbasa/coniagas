## Highlights:

- Canada Cobalt is now assembling a pilot plant at the Castle mine to produce bulk gravity concentrates on site for immediate processing into cobalt sulphate; 

- Through the company's proprietary Re-2OX process, SGS Lakefield in Peterborough, Ontario, is currently precipitating metals from Castle mine concentrate and crystalizing cobalt sulphate from an organic solution for battery sector evaluation; 

- Each of the first three underground drill holes on the first level of the Castle mine has intersected visually identifiable mineralization consisting of cobalt and nickel sulphides and native silver.

*Jacques Monette, Canada Cobalt director and mine consultant, stated: "Underground drilling and rehab are proceeding extremely well and we eagerly anticipate initial assay results. Almost all pilot plant equipment is now on site with feed from the first level being stockpiled. Plans are also being made to allow for underground drilling throughout the winter, so crews are busy and excited as we set the pace in the prolific Northern Ontario Cobalt Camp."*

Assembly and testing of the 500 kg per day pilot plant will be completed over the next several weeks with cobalt concentrate slated to be produced on site beginning during the third quarter. This will allow for a scaling up of the three-stage Re-2OX process at SGS Lakefield under the supervision of Dr. Ron Molnar of the Canada Cobalt Advisory Board.

SGS Lakefield has completed bulk SX (solvent extraction) testing with Re-2OX able to remove 99% of the arsenic from concentrate containing nearly 50% arsenic, while cobalt recovery rates are 99%.
