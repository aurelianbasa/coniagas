Metallurgical testwork performed by SGS Lakefield has demonstrated that historic stamp mill tailings at Canada Cobalt's Castle mine are amenable to flotation and leaching, enhancing potential recoveries and creating an opportunity for a direct shipping precious metal concentrate in addition to a Re-2OX cobalt sulphate. 

## Highlights:

- SGS has produced a high purity flotation silver concentrate grading **18,486 grams per tonne (539.17 ounces per ton);**
- Optimization is expected to increase the 70% recovery rate;
- Ontario is "Open For Business": Through its engineering partner, Canada Cobalt is working closely and productively with the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines to quickly secure an amendment to the company's existing advanced exploration permit to allow the proposed tailings program to proceed.

## Castle Tailings Amenable to Flotation

Through a flotation test, SGS has taken a gravity concentrate of a 120-kilogram sample from the Castle mine's historic tailings pond with a calculated head assay of 459 g/t silver and has created a high purity flotation concentrate grading 18,486 g/t with an initial recovery of 70%. 

Given these results, Canada Cobalt is immediately taking a much larger sample from the tailings for SGS to create another flotation concentrate including a cobalt concentrate.  The aim of the proposed tailings program is to produce a high purity direct shipping precious metal concentrate (silver and gold), while Canada Cobalt's proprietary Re-2OX Process would be used to convert a cobalt concentrate into a cobalt sulphate.
