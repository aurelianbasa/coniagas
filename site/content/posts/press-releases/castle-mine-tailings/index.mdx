The Company has added another catalyst to its first half 2019 strategy â€“ a unique and environmentally friendly program with a plan to develop cost-effective near-term recovery of silver and gold mineralization from an historic tailings area approximately 300 meters from the #3 Shaft at the Castle mine.

The Company considers the tailings very prospective for high-grade silver and other metals, including gold and cobalt, based on historical records and just-received results from SGS Lakefield which has produced a gravity concentrate from the tailings grading 389 g/t silver, 0.63 g/t gold and 0.20% cobalt.

The tailings program will initially target silver and gold and will be optimized through the Re-2OX process to recover other metals including cobalt, nickel and copper. It will also be used as a template by the Company for similar potential initiatives in Gowganda and elsewhere in the broader region where innovative approaches to decades-old tailings issues can deliver important environmental solutions as well as potential business growth opportunities.

## Highlights:

- Canada Cobalt has acquired gravity separation spiral concentrators, made by Mineral Technologies of Australia, for test work which is being undertaken to complete a flow sheet for a pilot plant that can treat a minimum of 600 tonnes of tailings per day;
- Mineral Technologies' spiral concentrators are designed to be highly efficient and easy to install, featuring minimal maintenance requirements and high recoveries;
- The stamp mill coarse tailings from early 20th century mining at Castle will be processed underground at the Castle mine near the #3 Shaft in a wide-open area on the first level;
- The stopes on the first level will be fully cleaned out and back-filled (cemented) with the tailings waste from the high-grade concentrate created underground.

*Frank J. Basa, Canada Cobalt President and CEO, commented. "The tailings 'problem' in Northeast Ontario's historic silver-cobalt mining district is really a tailings 'opportunity', and our intention is to capture that opportunity for Canada Cobalt shareholders.*

*"We've been a leader on multiple fronts in this district. We look forward to working closely with our First Nation partners and the Ministry of Mines to implement a tailings program at Castle that can be a model for similar initiatives in the Gowganda Camp and elsewhere throughout the region from the town of Cobalt to Silver Centre," Basa concluded.*

The above program is part of an amendment to the Company's advanced exploration permit with the Ontario Ministry of Northern Development and Mines.
