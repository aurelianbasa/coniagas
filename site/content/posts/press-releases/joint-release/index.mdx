## Processing Highlights

- Processing of mineralized core involves using one of the conventional mineral processing steps: gravity concentration, magnetic concentration or flotation. 

- Bench scale leach testing to be done on the Granada rare earth and alkali concentrate.

- Pilot plant leach testing to be done on the Granada rare earth and alkali concentrate.

The U.S. Department of the Interior published a final list of the 35 metals deemed critical to U.S. National Security and the Economy.  To view the original U.S. government list, follow [this link.](https://www.usgs.gov/news/interior-releases-2018-s-final-list-35-minerals-deemed-critical-us-national-security-and) The following is a list of the 14 metals now known to be present in various concentrations at the Granada Gold Mine property's new discovery on the Big Claim in the 588-meter GR-20-20 hole: arsenic, barite, cesium, cobalt, gallium, hafnium, magnesium, manganese, rubidium, scandium, strontium, tungsten, vanadium, and zirconium. 

Both Companies will continue to work together on this initiative and will look at market demand fundamentals for the rare earth and alkali metal compounds prior to commencing bench scale testing.

*CEO Frank J. Basa, P.Eng., commented that "We appear to have 40 percent of the metals deemed critical to the US national security - everything that is now coming into focus as being in short supply in the western world.  These recent developments are extremely exciting given that the timing coincides with an awareness that many countries must play catch up quickly.  Given the well-documented 2020 challenges in sourcing metals, this is resonating in a big way."*
