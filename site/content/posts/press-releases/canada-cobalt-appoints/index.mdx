**Highlights:**

- Continued underground bulk sampling at the Castle mine has assayed **2.46%** cobalt and **6,173** g/t (**198.5** ounces per tonne) silver;

- Hydrometallurgical and pilot plant specialist Dr. Ron Molnar has joined Canada Cobalt as a Special Advisor as the Company advances its Re-20X process.

Canada Cobalt's proprietary Re-2OX process for cobalt battery metals is being optimized at SGS Lakefield in southern Ontario. Dr. Molnar has designed, built and operated over 60 pilot plant circuits extracting, separating and purifying a wide range of metallic elements from cobalt to rare earths, and he will be one of the key individuals who will assist Canada Cobalt in taking Re-20X to the full pilot plant stage in 2018 with client specific cobalt formulations for the battery sector.

Meanwhile, Canada Cobalt's underground program at the Castle mine continues ahead of further rehabilitation and drilling. The latest selected bulk sample from the floor of the first level of the mine, crushed, blended and assayed by SGS Lakefield, has returned 2.46% cobalt, 1.0% nickel and 6,173 g/t silver (198.5 ounces per tonne). Native silver was not included in that pulp assay. A metallic screen fire assay was performed on the native silver, producing a head grade of 818,254 g/t (26,307 ounces per tonne).  Canada Cobalt cautions that samples are selective and not representative of mineralization underground at the Castle mine.

Rehab engineers have noted that cobalt mineralization remains in the stopes on the first level of the mine.

With its Re-20X process, upcoming underground drill program and other initiatives, Canada Cobalt is strategically and uniquely positioned in the northern Ontario Cobalt Camp to benefit from the electric vehicle super-cycle and the continuing uptrend in cobalt prices.
